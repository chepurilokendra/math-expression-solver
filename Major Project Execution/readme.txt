
1) Copy the all the files in the folder into local disk

2) Use a code editor preferrably visual studio code.

3) Before running the code necessary packages need to be installed.

4) Firstly install python in your system (use python 3.8 and above versions).

5) Run the below command in command prompt.

"pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas PIL matplotlib flask opencv sympy wtforms werkzeug"

6) You can use the already trained model in the folder named "model_epoch_5".

7) Or if you want to train the model on your own then run the "model_generator.py" file the dataset used in this file is available on kaggle.

8)The link to the dataset is "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xainano/handwrittenmathsymbols" .

9) For faster training speeds use a GPU

10) Replace all the paths in the code with paths respect to your local disk

11)Run the code using command "python app.py" in command prompt.

12)The application will be opened in the web browser.

13) Use the canvas to draw or upload image directly via file upload

14) For result click save and then calculate button if you use the canvas, or just calculate button if input is provided through file upload.
